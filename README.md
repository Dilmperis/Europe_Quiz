# Europe Quiz (HTML Practice Project)

A small project I come back to whenever I have time to train my HTML/CSS/JavaScript skills.

Instead of building random demos, I like making the learning process useful too, so while I practice frontend basics, I also train real-world knowledge (in this case: **European countries and capitals**).  
Code + geography = good combo for a Sunday evening...

## What this repo do:

- Shows a map of Europe
- Dynamic Quiz mode for **countries** or for **capitals**
- Auto-zoom on the current country (with better zoom for tiny countries)
- Manual zoom/pan support
- Auto-next when you answer correctly

## Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dilmperis/Europe_Quiz.git
